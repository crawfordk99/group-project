# Overview
This project is a social media app named Hidden Gem. It allows you to create and share posts of any kind. In the future, a feature will be implemented allowing for prompts to be created and will correspond to each post.

# Running the Software
Once downloaded to your computer, ensure that the latest version of Firebase is installed. In the terminal, run the command:
```
firebase emulators:start --import=.\emulator-data --export-on-exit=.\emulator-data
```
This will start the firebase emulator. Then you can start the program by running this command in a new terminal.
```
flutter run
```
